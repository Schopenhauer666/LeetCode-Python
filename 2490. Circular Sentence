#This program reads a sentence, checks each word's last letter against the next word's first letter (case-insensitively), and verifies if the sentence forms a circular chain.
class Solution:
    def isCircularSentence(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
        #For each space character found (sentence[i] == ' '):
#Check if the character before the space (sentence[i - 1]) is not equal to the character after the space (sentence[i + 1]).
#If they are not equal, return false (indicating the sentence is not circular).
        for i in range(len(sentence)):
            if sentence[i] == " " and sentence[i - 1] != sentence[i + 1]:
                return False
        #and now check if the first character and last are equal
        return sentence[0] == sentence[len(sentence) - 1]
    
    # If all checks pass, the sentence is circular
