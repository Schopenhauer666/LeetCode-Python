#For each bit position (from 0-24 assuming we have 24-bit integers), we count how many candidates have a 1 at that bit.
#then we find the maximum count of 1s at the same posiiton and thats the answer.
class Solution:
    def largestCombination(self, candidates: List[int]) -> int:
        max_count=0

        for i in range(24):
            count=0
            for num in candidates:
                if num & (1<<i):
                    count+=1
            max_count=max(max_count,count)

        return max_count
