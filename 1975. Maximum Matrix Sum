#If there are an odd number of negative elements, one of them must remain negative in the final configuration.
#To minimize the penalty, we subtract twice the smallest absolute value from the total sum.
#If the number of negatives is even, the entire matrix can be made non-negative, resulting in the sum of all absolute values.
