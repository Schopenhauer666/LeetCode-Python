#To solve this you have to think simple. When you reverse the box by 90 your columns will be the rows from before. So you start go through 
#its single row of obx starting from the endof it. This will be the drop position. Going to the left of the row you checking if there is
# a # so you can put it that the dropPos. If you find a * you make this, the new dropPos. At the end you reverse the rows of the box with [::-1] and roatate the box with zip*.
class Solution:
    def rotateTheBox(self, box: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        for row in box:
            dropPos = len(row) - 1  
            
            for currPos in range(len(row)-1, -1, -1):
                if row[currPos] == "*":  
                    dropPos = currPos - 1
                elif row[currPos] == "#":  
                    row[dropPos], row[currPos] = row[currPos], row[dropPos]
                    dropPos -= 1

        result = zip(*box[::-1])
        return result
